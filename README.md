# BuildAndroid

A handy tool for those who want to be a build bot / learn to build.

## Introduction

To keep things simple, I will refer to LineageOS as LOS in certain places.

BuildAndroid has been developed to teach people how to build android, while also doubling up as a simple script that can be edited, to automate the android build process.

For the sake of simplicity on my part, this script will build [LineageOS v17](https://lineageos.org/) (formally CyanogenMOD) from the repo located [here](https://github.com/lineageos). It will use the manifest branch `lineage-17.0` which is LOS's Android 10. It will try to stay as LineageOS based as possible, requiring 3rd party `trees` where necessary.
